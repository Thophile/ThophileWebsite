                I have always wanted to be useful to the society, my natural talent for logics oriented me to an IT formation after a "scientific Baccalaur√©at" 
                I think IT have and will have a huge place in the society as a tool to help everyone and make any task easier and as an entertainment tool too.
                With so said roll IT is a perfect choice to use the most of my capacity while doing something good for helping people</p>

                I like to do the most I can by myself.
                It all started when I was a first year primary student when was authorized for the first time to use an axe saw and I never stopped working on manual project during my free time since ! 
                
                I like to learn and I like useless or beautifull gadget but i'm not that rich so I can't buy all the thing I find fun or pretty. 
                Most of the time I end up watching tutorials and building them myself for a 10th of the price. Sometimes it cost me 10 times the price but I always end up learning something new and having a lot of fun !
