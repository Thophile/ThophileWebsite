I think that IT has and will have a huge place in society as a tool to help everyone, facilitate any task and as an entertainment tool. With such a role, IT is a perfect choice to make the most of my abilities while doing something good to help people.",

I have never stopped working on manual projects in my spare time since! \n\n I like to learn and I like useless or beautiful gadgets but I am not so rich so I cannot buy everything that I find fun or pretty. Most of the time, I end up watching tutorials and building them myself for a 10th of the price. Sometimes it costs me 10 times the price but I always end up learning something new and I have a lot of fun!"
